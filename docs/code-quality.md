# Code Quality and Maintainability

## Overview

This feature focuses on improving the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier to understand, debug, and extend in the future. It covers aspects of CSS refactoring and JavaScript modularity.

## Setup Instructions

These enhancements primarily involve direct modifications to existing code files (`styles.css` and JavaScript files in `assets/js/`). No new files are typically added for setup.

### CSS Refactoring

-   **Organization:** Group related CSS properties and rules together. Consider using a consistent ordering for properties (e.g., box model, typography, visual).
-   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent naming conventions (e.g., BEM, utility-first classes) are applied throughout the stylesheet.
-   **Readability:** Use consistent indentation, spacing, and comments to improve readability.
-   **Redundancy:** Identify and remove duplicate or redundant CSS rules.

### JavaScript Modularity

-   **Encapsulation:** Ensure functions and variables are scoped appropriately to avoid global pollution. Most of the existing JavaScript files already use `DOMContentLoaded` listeners, which helps with this.
-   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Verify that each JavaScript file or function has a clear, single responsibility.
-   **Readability:** Maintain consistent coding style, clear variable names, and add comments for complex logic.

## Customization

-   **Coding Standards:** You can define and enforce specific coding standards (e.g., using ESLint for JavaScript, Stylelint for CSS) to automate consistency checks.
-   **Modular Structure:** For larger projects, consider more advanced modular patterns (e.g., ES Modules with build tools) if the project complexity grows.

## Accessibility Notes

-   Improved code quality indirectly benefits accessibility by making the codebase easier to maintain and extend, thus reducing the likelihood of introducing accessibility regressions.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Linting Errors:** If you introduce linting tools, address any reported errors or warnings to maintain code quality.
-   **Behavioral Changes:** After refactoring, thoroughly test the website to ensure no existing functionality has been inadvertently broken.

## Dependencies

No new external libraries are required for these code quality improvements.
